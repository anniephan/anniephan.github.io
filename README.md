This is Annie Phan's website. Inspired by the UNIX man pages, this website is fully **functional**, **responsive**, and **simple**. It features a **classic design** that never goes out of style; it certainly holds a special place in any classic developer's heart-<3. 

It's also super **lightweight** and **fast**. Oh, and did I mention **responsive**? :D
