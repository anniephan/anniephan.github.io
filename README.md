This is Annie Phan's website. Inspired by the UNIX man pages, this website is fully functional, responsive, and simple. It features a classic design that never goes out of style; it holds a special place in any classic developer's heart <3. It's super lightweight and fast. Oh, and did I mention responsive? :D
